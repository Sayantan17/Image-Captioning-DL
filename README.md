# Image-Captioning-DL
The image captioning is one of the most important & crucial tasks of the machine learning. This task is accomplished bybusing the prerequisites of Deep learning with the help of python (Anaconda) especially 3.6 , the coding lines are reproduced originally by Jason Brownlee (Deep / Machine line expert) , for which i would like to thank him. This test is originally done in VGG 16 which you can also perform in Inception in the flicker 8k Dataset which you can get from these just by pushing a sign up.

The required libraries would be:-
Keras 
Theano/Tensorflow
Imgaug
Tqdm
Scipy
Numpy
Rest will be preuploaded by Anaconda.
Support Added-GPU (TENSORFLOW)
Though there is some bug in keras(Backend-Theano) which I will be sorting out in a few days.
Especially the task was created by building CNN & then feeding the data to LSTM network.
